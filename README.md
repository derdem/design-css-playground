## frontend

-   Typescript
-   Vite
-   Vue 3
-   Pinia
-   Vue Router

## backend

-   Typescript
-   express

# Starting application

-   cd frontend && npm install
-   npm run dev

if you have docker installed you can also go to the root of this project and start it via `docker compose up`
this also starts the backend which however has no functionality yet.
